## Dataset Overview

This project uses a synthetic regression dataset generated programmatically to allow controlled experimentation.

No raw data files are stored here.  
All datasets (base, noisy, multicollinear, and small-sample variants) are created dynamically using functions in `src/data_generator.py`.

This approach ensures:
- Full reproducibility
- Clear control over data conditions
- Focus on model behavior rather than data cleaning
